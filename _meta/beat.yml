################### Cloudflarebeat Configuration Example #########################

############################# Cloudflarebeat ######################################

cloudflarebeat:
  #### Cloudflare Common Settings ####
  # These settings can be applied on cloudflarebeat level, and/or
  # on consumer level. This way you can provide defaults for all
  # zones, with the option to override them for specific zones.

  # Credentials
  api_email: "user@example.com"
  api_key: "0123456789abcdef"

  # Maximum allow time period to request logs for in a single request.
  # This setting should be lowered for zones with very high traffic volume.
  # That's due to a limitation with Cloudflare's ELS system.
  # See the "Requests will fail when" section at
  # https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/216672448-Enterprise-Log-Share-Logpull-REST-API
  #max_pull_size: 60m

  # Limit how far back we start importing logs.
  # This is only relevant for the initial import, when starting this beat for
  # the first time, or when stopping this beat. When it is stopped
  # longer than this priod of time, you'll "lose" logs.
  #oldest_allowed: 120m


  ## The following settings shouldn't be changed from their default

  # It takes some time for logs to become available in Cloudflare's system.
  # The default will limit us to logs older than 10 minutes.
  #newest_allowed: 10m

  # The main log importer loop won't request logs if the time range to be
  # imported is ness than 1 minute.
  #margin: 1m

  # The amount of time to wait before retying in case an error occurrs.
  #backoff: 30s

  # New logs will be requested ever 5 minutes.
  #pull_interval: 5m

  # Distributes log pull evenly within pull_interval
  # This is meant to reduce stress on the output.
  #pull_offset_enabled: true


  #### Clouflare Log Consumers ####

  # Define for which zones logs should be imported.
  # The minimum valid config looks like this:
  #consumers:
  #  - zones:
  #      - example.com

  consumers:
    # small websites
    - oldest_allowed: 24h
      zones:
        - example.com
        - example.com

    # medium traffic volume websites; shorter max_pull_size, see above
    - max_pull_size: 30m
      zones:
        - example.com

    # very high traffic volume websites; very short max_pull_size, see above
    - max_pull_size: 5m
      zones:
        - example.com

  # If necessary, fields can also be specified (or overridden)
  # on consumer level.
